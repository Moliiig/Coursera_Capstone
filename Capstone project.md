# Capstone project
## Description of the problem
When moving to a new country the biggest question is where to move. Is there any city or town that's similar to mine? Are there any schools, Universities, Hospitals, Parks and Shops there? How about GDP, quantity of people, life-style, rent-cost?

With so many alternatives and so many variables is easy to get lost and with so much information it's easy to misunderstand what the data is telling you. It would be great if there was a comparison of the different cities in a country of choice which gives you a general view of each place and it's pro's and contra's.

In this case the problem will be moving from a Southamerican country (Chile) to Germany, and the family would like to have a priority list of the places which better satisfy their requirements.

The requirements are:  
* schools
* hostpitals
* security
* shops
* entertainment
* crowded/ not crowded
* quality of living
* Gross Domestic Product per employee
* Gross Domestic Product per capita
* rent-cost
 

## Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem

Well use the following data:

1. List of German cities by population - Wikipedia
2. List of German cities by GDP - Wikipedia
3. [ ] rent
4. Foursquare list of venues and categories for schools, universities, health, shops ad entertainment
5.  OECD Better Life Index

The data will be obtained, clean and merged into a dataset and then several techniques will be applied to understand the data.

A matrix of preferences will also be made for the family asigning an importance from 0 to 1 to each selected category and then a recommendation will be made using a item-base collaborative filter
